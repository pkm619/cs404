How joystic works:

==>The Joystick consists of four potentiometers attached to its base. 
==>As the Joystick moves in a particular direction, the potentiometers are rotated and the values are altered 
leading to a change in the positioning of the joystick as read by the Beaglebone.
==>Based on the readings obtained these devices are controlled.
