The goals of this lab are

1.Interface an analog joystick.
2.If you have done the LED Matrix lab, have the joystick control your Etch�a�Sketch. 
If not,have it control the brightness of two LEDs.
3.Interface a Rotary Encoder.



How joystic works:

==>The Joystick consists of four potentiometers attached to its base. 
==>As the Joystick moves in a particular direction, the potentiometers are rotated and the values are altered 
leading to a change in the positioning of the joystick as read by the Beaglebone.
==>Based on the readings obtained these devices are controlled. 






 This lab made us get familiarized with the joystick, which is a basic device used in many places.
