Sub : Report on lab 04

So the main aim of the lab was to learn how to control a matrix via javascript.

To do so we followed the following steps:

1.Run matrixLEDi2c.js to be sure your LEDs are wired correctly.  

2.We Studied the code and modify the code to make the frowning face appear upside down compared to the smiling one.

3.Later we make it fade out and in when another button is pressed.  

In this we also used a Etch-A-sketch program to display the pattern on the LED Matrix as the user presses the buttons.
