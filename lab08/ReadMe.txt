The aim of the lab was to get started working with linux kernel.
For this lab first we need to have linux kernel source. 

In this lab we first pull exploringBB repo from Derek Molley. In exploringBB we went into /extras/kernel/hello where we found our file hello.c .
There is one Makefile also which help in compiling and executing our hello.c . First we changed the parameter of 'name' variabel from'world' to 'DerekMolley'.

Later on we copy hello.c in new file hello2.c in which add a parameter 'addr' containing value 'IIT'.We print it on our terminal usinf printK command which is like prinf for kernel module.
