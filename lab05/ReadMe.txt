Sub : Report on lab 05

The goals of this lab are

1.Interface multiple types of sensors to the Bone.
2.Compare the sensors for range and accuracy.


For this purpose we used Ultrasonic Range Finder � XL�MaxSonar�EZ1 sensor.

The sensors work on the 
principle of reflection of waves sent from the sensors, which on reflection from the surface of the 
obstacle returns to the reciever in the sensor. Based on the time delay, the distance of the obstacle 
from the source is calculated Ultrasonic sensor Reading.
