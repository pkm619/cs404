Sub : Report on lab 03

From this lab we leant how to use a potientiometer and a js fiddle software to control our led brightness and power


In lab 03 we use two LED's for following purpose: 
1. To glow both the LEDs 
2. To glow one LED's while another one fade away 
3. To control the brightness of both the LED's using a poteniometer 
4. Then we use fiddle to saw our code and make some changes in our code like we get 
values of potentiometer and a button on screen to turn off and on the LED's.

There are two parts in JSFIDDLE code. One is html part and another is javascript code.
